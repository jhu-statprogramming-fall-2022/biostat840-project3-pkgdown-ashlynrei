**An R package to create “Table 1”, description of baseline
characteristics**

Creates “Table 1”, i.e., description of baseline patient
characteristics, which is essential in every medical research. Supports
both continuous and categorical variables, as well as p-values and
standardized mean differences. Weighted data are supported via the
survey package.

tableone was inspired by descriptive statistics functions in Deducer , a
Java-based GUI package by Ian Fellows. This package does not require GUI
or Java, and intended for command-line users.

tableone code example
=====================

In this table, continuous and categorical variables can be placed in any
order. The p-valeus are from exact tests for pre-specified variables.
For nonnormal variables, it shows median and IQR instead of mean and SD,
and p-values are from nonparametric tests. Numerically coded categorical
variables can be transformed on the fly with factorVars. SMD stands for
standardized mean differences. For weighted data, first created a
svydesign object, and use the svyCreateTableOne() function. Most other
options remain the same.

    ## Load package
    library(tableone)
    ## Load data
    data(pbc, package = "survival")
    # drop ID from variable list
    vars <- names(pbc)[-1]
    ## Create Table 1 stratified by trt (can add more stratifying variables)
    tableOne <- CreateTableOne(vars = vars, strata = c("trt"), data = pbc,
                                factorVars = c("status","edema","stage"))
    ## Specifying nonnormal variables will show the variables appropriately,
    ## and show nonparametric test p-values. Specify variables in the exact
    ## argument to obtain the exact test p-values.
    print(tableOne, nonnormal = c("bili","chol","copper","alk.phos","trig"),
          exact = c("status","stage"), smd = TRUE,
          formatOptions = list(big.mark = ","))
